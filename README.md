### Project Overview

A simple tool to track, categorize and visualize organization expenses, helping to manage their budget effectively. Features include adding and editing transactions, generating summaries, and providing insights into spending patterns for smarter financial decisions.



### Data Source

The sample dataset (`expenses.csv`) is adapted from publicly available data on [Kaggle – Personal Expense Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/personal-expense-data) for demonstration purposes.

### Tools

Microsoft Excel (for cleaning, analysis and visualization)
- [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com)

### Data Cleaning and Preparation Process

- Imported raw transaction data into Excel and formatted it as a structured table.
- Removed duplicate entries and handled missing values appropriately.
- Standardized data types (dates and numeric amounts) and cleaned text fields for consistency.
- Created additional columns (Month, Year, Month-Year) to support time-based analysis.
- Applied data validation and reviewed outliers to ensure accuracy and reliability.
  
 Final Outcome: 
The dataset was successfully cleaned, standardized, and structured for analysis. The prepared data enables accurate expense categorization, trend analysis, and summary reporting using Pivot Tables and charts.
   

### Exploratory Data Analysis

 The exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand spending patterns, identify trends, and uncover key insights within the transaction dataset.
 - Total Spending Analysis: Calculated overall expenditure to determine total money spent within the selected time frame.
 - Category-wise Breakdown: Used Pivot Tables to analyze total and average spending per category, identifying the highest and lowest expense areas.
 - Monthly Trend Analysis: Grouped transactions by month to observe spending trends and detect increases or decreases over time.
 - Top Transactions Review: Sorted transactions by amount to identify high-value expenses and potential outliers.
 - Spending Frequency Analysis: Evaluated how often expenses occur across categories to detect recurring patterns.

Key Insights:
The analysis revealed dominant spending categories, recurring expense patterns, and variations in monthly expenditure, providing actionable insights for better budgeting and financial decision-making.

### Data Analysis

In this project, I perform a detailed analysis of personal expenses to identify spending patterns and trends. The an alysis includes:
   - Expenses by Category: Transactions are grouped into categories such as Food, Transportation, Utilities, and Others to provide a clear overview of where money is being spent.
   - Monthly Trends: Visualizations highlight fluctuations in spending over time, helping to identify peak spending periods.
   - Top Spending Categories: The analysis identifies the categories with the highest expenses which is uncategorized, allowing for more informed budgeting decisions.
   - Expense Distribution: Bar graphs display the proportion of spending in each category, giving a quick snapshot of financial priorities.
   - Insights & Recommendations: Based on patterns observed in the data, actionable insights are suggested to optimize budgeting and reduce unnecessary expenses.






### Insight 

The data highlights two main financial control issues:
  1.  Lack of Expense Classification.
       - Nearly 23% of transactions are uncategorized.
       - Over $22,000 lacks preoper visibility.
       - This reduces the ability to monitor budgets effectively.
    
  2.  High Concentration in Daily Spending.
     - Nearly half of all spending (47%) comes from routine categories.
     - Small daily eexpenses collectively create large financial impact.
     - Even a small Percentage reduction could result in significant 
savings.

For example: 
   - A 10% reduction in Food, Coffee, Shopping and Transport
     = Approximately $4,622 in potential savings.

 
 ### Recommendation

 1. Reclassify Uncategorized Expenses
    - Target reduction from 23% to below 5%.
    - Improve reporting accuracy and transparency.
   
 2. Set spending limits for high-frequency categories
      - Focus on Food, Coffee, Shopping and Transport(47% of total spend).
   
 3. Review Subscriptions and recurring costs
    - Assess value for money.
    - Cancel unused services.
   
 4. Implement monthly Expense Reviews
    - Detect overspending early.
    - Strenghen budgeting and financial planning.
 
### Conclusuion

Total spending across 2024-2025 amount to $98,469 across 1000 transactions. 

Key Takeaways: 
  - 22.8% ($22,445) of spending is uncategorized.
  - 47% ($46,224) comes from everyday expenses.
  - 21% ($20,723) is tied to recurring commitments.
  - Utilities represent the lowestcost at 9.2%

By improving expenses categorization and controlling recurring daily spending, the organization can increase financial visibility, improve budgeting accuracy and potentially reduce costs by several thousands dollars annually.
